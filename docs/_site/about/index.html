<p>Project Overview:</p>

<p>The University of Chicago Data Science Institute’s Data &amp; Democracy team addressed a longstanding gap in election research by creating a comprehensive, machine-readable archive of U.S. election results from 1920 through 1996. Faced with 51 bulky PDFs containing over 3,000 pages of scanned precinct-level returns for House, Senate, and Presidential contests, we devised a three-stage OCR pipeline centered on the Claude API. This archive is important because it unlocks decades of electoral history that were previously inaccessible for large-scale quantitative analysis—enabling researchers to trace long-term voting patterns, study shifts in party support, and evaluate the evolution of democratic participation across states.</p>

<h2 id="methodology">Methodology</h2>

<p>At the core of our solution is a three-stage pipeline:</p>

<p>PDF to Images: We batch-converted 51 state PDFs (over 3,000 pages!) into ordered image sequences, ensuring each race, precinct, and contest appears in the correct reading order.</p>

<p>Prompted OCR Extraction: Every image is fed to Claude with carefully engineered prompts. Our system prompt establishes context (e.g. “Ignore table borders; extract STATE, YEAR, RACE_TYPE, DISTRICT, CANDIDATE, PARTY, VOTES”), while parameters like temperature and max tokens are tuned to balance fidelity against hallucination.</p>

<p>Validation &amp; CSV Generation: Claude’s raw output is post-processed with two custom validators: a character-level edit-distance check for text fields (to tolerate minor punctuation or spacing variations) and a digit-accuracy metric that measures the fraction of correctly recognized digits in numeric vote counts. Cleaned records are assembled into per-year CSV files that align with our target schema for downstream analysis.</p>

<p>To optimize accuracy, we constructed training/test datasets by manually labeling a subset of pages and comparing them against Claude’s outputs. We iteratively refined our system prompts—altering instructions to ignore extraneous table elements, adjusting model versions, and calibrating hyperparameters—until we reached our target thresholds for both text and numeric fields. We achieved outstanding accuracy—100 percent in state, race type, district, and party; 94 percent in candidate names; and 98 percent in vote totals. The result is a standardized set of per-state, per-year CSV files that conform to a unified schema, unlocking decades of electoral history for researchers, journalists, and civic technologists.</p>
